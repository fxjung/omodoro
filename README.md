- option to pause and continue the cycle
- option to abort the current pomodori or break and start the next one
- commandline argument for user-specific pomodoro cycle
- _/home/$USER/.omodoro.conf_ or _APPDATA\omodoro.conf_ configuration file for user-specific pomodoro cycle
- runs on any system with Python installed - Linux, Windows and others

### 4. Requirements

omodoro has the following requirements:

- Python 3
- libnotify (on all Systems except Microsoft Windows)

### 5. Usage

Run the script with python:

`python omodoro`

When omodoro is running, you can type:

- __p__ to pause the current pomodoro cycle
- __c__ to continue the current pomodoro cycle - the end time will be adjusted
- __n__ to abort the current pomodori or break and start the next one
- __q__ to quit omodoro

### 6. Customization

You can adjust the pomodoro cycle to your needs by

1. editing the variables in the __SETTINGS__ section of the omodoro script

2. copying the file _omodoro.conf.sample_ as _.omodoro.conf_ into your home
directory and modifying it

3. adding a commandline argument by running omodoro like this:

`python omodoro P-L-S-B`

with

	P	number of pomodori to do in a cycle
	L	length of one pomodori in minutes
	S	length of a short break in minutes
	B	length of a long break in minutes

Example with the default values:

`python omodoro 4-25-5-15`

### 7. Todo list

These are things which are planned to be done, at some point
in the future.

- require acknowledgement for next pomodoro/break
- tk or gtk GUI
- don't do a pomodoro cycle, just measure work/break times

- sound output for other platforms than linux

### 8 Known issues
- Skipping pomodori does not terminate the cycle up to the long break
